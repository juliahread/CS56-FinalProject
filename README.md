This game was developed by Sean Costello, Owen Gillespie, Janice Lee, and Julia Read for CS056 (Object-Oriented Game Development) Spring 2019. Special thanks to Professor Saleem for helping us along the way!

## Description and Controls
### Backstory
It's the year 2200, and the Claremont Colleges have successfully migrated to space... But over-enrollment in CS 5 at HMC has caused a singularity to form, and the Claremont Colleges have been destroyed! Now you are floating in the depths of space... Armed with a grappling hook, a jetpack, and your knowledge of zero-gravity physics, you must reach the Campus Safety vehicle before the time runs out in order to survive. Good luck!
### Controls
+ Left Click - shoot the grappling hook
+ Right Click - detach the grappling hook
+ WASD - control the jetpack
+ ![alttext](https://github.com/juliahread/CS56-FinalProject/blob/master/images/apple.png "Fuel") - additional fuel
+ ![alttext](https://github.com/juliahread/CS56-FinalProject/blob/master/images/oldenborg_smaller.png "Oldenborg Fuel Depot") - fuel depot
+ ![alttext](https://github.com/juliahread/CS56-FinalProject/blob/master/images/end_smaller.png) - Campus Safety vehicle

## Compilation Instructions
### On Linux
You will need the following libraries: ```SDL2, SDL2_Image, SDL2_TTF, and SDL2_Mixer```.
To install, run 
```
#install sdl2
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-2.0-0 -y

#install sdl image
sudo apt-get install libjpeg9-dev libwebp-dev libtiff5-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-image-2.0-0 -y

#install sdl true type fonts
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 -y

#install sdl mixer
sudo apt-get install libmikmod-dev libfishsound1-dev libsmpeg-dev liboggz2-dev libflac-dev libfluidsynth-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 -y
```

## Game Requirements
+ Polymorphism: 
  The Entity class is an abstract class with the functions ``` void render(SDL_Renderer *renderer) ``` and  ``` void update() ```, which the majority of the objects displayed on the screen inherit from. Also, all of the commands (select menu option, fire grappling hook, use jetpack) inherit from the Command class.
+ At least 2 design patterns:
  We used the Singleton design pattern for the Camera class so that changing the position of the camera is guarenteed. We also used the Command design pattern for the different commands, making it easy to implement and execute.
+ File I/O:
  We read in the game map from an image, and also implemented saving high scores to a file. 
+ Operator overloading:
  The ``` - ``` operator is overloaded in the Vec2D class.
+ Memory management:
  We made sure to free all textures and surfaces and also deallocate any memory that was allocated by ```new```.
+ Good programming style:
  All lines are under 80 characters! We also tried to keep good programming practices in mind as we developed our classes and functions.
