This game was developed by Sean Costello, Owen Gillespie, Janice Lee, and Julia Read for CS056 (Object-Oriented Game Development) Spring 2019. Special thanks to Professor Saleem for helping us along the way!

## Description and Controls
### Backstory
It's the year 2200, and the Claremont Colleges have successfully migrated to space... But over-enrollment in CS 5 at HMC has caused a singularity to form, and the Claremont Colleges have been destroyed! Now you are floating in the depths of space... Armed with a grappling hook, a jetpack, and your knowledge of zero-gravity physics, you must reach the Campus Safety vehicle before the time runs out in order to survive. Good luck!
